This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
After weeks of coding (and debugging!), I’m thrilled to introduce Weatherify — a weather app that goes beyond basic forecasts!

🔧 Tech Stack:
 • Next.js 14 (App Router)
 • TypeScript
 • Redux Toolkit (with RTK Query)
 • Tailwind CSS
 • WeatherAPI.com

✨ Key Features:

✅ Real-time weather with Redux state management
✅ 3-day interactive forecast
✅ Persistent search history
✅ Fully responsive design
✅ Type-safe API integration

💡 Technical Highlights:

🔹 Redux middleware for smooth async flows
🔹 Optimized performance with memoized selectors
🔹 Error handling pipeline
🔹 Normalized state structure for scalability
